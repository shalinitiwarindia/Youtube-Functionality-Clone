YouTube Clone Website Description

The website is a clone of YouTube that allows users to search for videos and play them. The core features of the website include:

Video Search Functionality: Users can enter keywords into a search bar to find videos. The search results are displayed as a list or grid of video thumbnails, along with titles and basic information about each video.

Video Playback: Once a user selects a video, it is embedded on a new page or in a modal for playback. The video is streamed from a source (e.g., YouTube or a custom API) and plays in a video player with standard controls (play, pause, volume, etc.).

The website aims to mimic the core features of YouTube, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience for searching and viewing videos.
